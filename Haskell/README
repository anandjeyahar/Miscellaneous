Just a bunch of scripts i use/wrote/learnt during playtime.


Warning: Some of the codes are stolen/copied from snippets on the web, here and there, i wanted to try it out and so i just copied and ran it. 

That's one of the reasons i haven't added any license here
(because i can't fucking go around reading all the licenses i copy code from 
and see how they can be compatible with what i chose for this one.that way i'll never get anything done.)

If your code is in here, and you don't want it to be, please drop me a message/mail with a link to your original and i'll be happy to remove it from here.
