\section {Projects-Academics:}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Wrote a Bar,pie, graph drawing library/application in C++ for a intra college programming competition.

		\item Automation of a Thread profile inspection: Recommended a modified image processing based algorithm using CCD cameras and a coupled computer, to capture the thread profile and compare it with the required thread profile, thereby eliminating Manual testing.

	 	\item Duration judgement vs physical fatigue a correlation study: As part of the coursework,ran an experiment to study how duration judgement varies with different fatigue conditions.

		\item Eye-movement Studies: Colloborated in designing and coding the stimulus presentation for a Eye-movement study on Language ComprehensionVisual world paradigm.

		\item Colloborated in design and coded the stimulus presentation for a Eye-movement study on Emotional Reappraisal.

		\item Classification of puns: Developed a semantic ambiguity measure,using wordnet DB(nltk.wordnet) and similarity values extracted from it.Essentially constructed a graph of senses of all the words in the text(sentence). Then subgraphs are formed and their minimal spanning tree(MST) is calculated. The variance of total Weight of the MSTs is used as an ambiguity measure to classify puns and nonsense texts.
